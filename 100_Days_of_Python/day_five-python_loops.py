### For loops and the range() function
# # totaling numbers from 1 to 100
# total = 0
# for number in range(1, 101):
#     total += number
# print(total)

# ### Sum of even numbers from 1 to 100
# total = 0
# for number in range(1, 101):
#     if number % 2 == 0:
#         total += number
# print(total)
# ## It can also be done like this...
# total2 = 0
# for number in range(2, 101, 2):
#     total2 += number
# print(total2)

### FizzBuzz

for number in range(1, 101):
    if number % 3 == 0 and number % 5 == 0:
        print("FizzBuzz")
    elif number % 3 ==0:
        print('Fizz')
    elif number % 5 == 0:
        print('Buzz')
    else:
        print(number)
