# Python_Playground

After completing  the UCF data Analytics and Visualization bootcamp, I want to do a deeper dive into Python. I have created this repo to store new code I learn and show case my progress. 

To start it off, I found a course on Udemy: *100 Days of Code:the Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022* and will submit code for each day. It starts out VERY basic, but I will still complete the exercises to reinforce what I have already learned.
